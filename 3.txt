As I learned about technology in college and been working in the software field for a long time, 
I would like to learn coding and automation test. 
There are many reasons but I find two basics one.

First of all, automation test is a must skill for all future software QA jobs. 
With the software development changes over years, automation test rises as a trending skill. 
If I want to improve my career as a QA, this is the first skill to be trained.

Secondly, QAs have to know coding. 
I think there is no need for forcing QAs to write code but QAs should know how the code works. 
With this view, catching bugs could be easier because we know the work flow of coding.
